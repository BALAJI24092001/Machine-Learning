### System of Linear Equations

A **system of linear equations** is a set of two or more linear equations with the same set of variables. Each equation represents a straight line, and the solution to the system is the point or points where the lines intersect.

A general form of a system of two linear equations with two variables is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_1x + b_1y &= c_1 \\
a_2x + b_2y &= c_2
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:
- $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2, c_1, c_2$ are constants
- $x \; and \; y$ are variables

##### Types of Solutions:
1. **Unique Solution**: The lines intersect at a single point.
2. **Infinite Solutions**: The lines are coincident (i.e., they lie on top of each other).
3. **No Solution**: The lines are parallel and never intersect.

(Geometric Interpretation of Systems of Linear Equations) :  In a system of linear equations with two variables x1, x2, each linear equation defines a line on the x1x2-plane. Since a solution to a system of linear equations must satisfy all equations simultaneously, the solution set is the intersection of these lines. This intersection set can be a line (if the linar equations describe the same line), a point, or empty (when the lines are parallel)

Similarly, for three variables, each linear equation determines a plane in three-dimensional space. When we intersect these planes, i.e., satisfy all linear equations at the same time, we can obtain a solution set that is a plane, a line, a point or empty (when the planes have no common intersection).

### Matrix Form of System of Linear Equations

The system of linear equations can be written in matrix form as:

$$
Ax = b
$$

Where:
- \( A \) is the matrix of coefficients
- \( x \) is the column vector of variables
- \( b \) is the column vector of constants

For a system of 2 equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_1x + b_1y &= c_1 \\
a_2x + b_2y &= c_2
\end{aligned}
$$

This can be represented in matrix form as:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a_1 & b_1 \\
a_2 & b_2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
c_1 \\
c_2
\end{pmatrix}
$$


The system of linear equations in individual vector multiplication form is:

$$
x
\begin{pmatrix}
a_1 \\
a_2
\end{pmatrix}
+
y \begin{pmatrix}
b_1 \\
b_2
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
c_1 \\
c_2
\end{pmatrix}
$$


#### Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is defined as the dot product of rows and columns between two matrices. The number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix.

If \( A \) is an \( m \times n \) matrix and \( B \) is an \( n \times p \) matrix, their product \( AB \) is an \( m \times p \) matrix:

$$
C = AB, \quad \text{where} \ C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{ik}B_{kj}
$$

For example, for \( A \) (2x3) and \( B \) (3x2):

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{pmatrix} 
b_{11} & b_{12} \\
b_{21} & b_{22} \\
b_{31} & b_{32}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Their product is:

$$
AB = \begin{pmatrix} 
a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21} + a_{13}b_{31} & a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22} + a_{13}b_{32} \\
a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21} + a_{23}b_{31} & a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22} + a_{23}b_{32}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

#### Matrix Addition

Two matrices of the same dimensions can be added element-wise:

If \( A \) and \( B \) are both \( m \times n \) matrices, then their sum \( C \) is:

$$
C = A + B, \quad \text{where} \ C_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij}
$$

For example:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{pmatrix} 
5 & 6 \\
7 & 8
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Their sum is:

$$
A + B = \begin{pmatrix} 
6 & 8 \\
10 & 12
\end{pmatrix}
$$

#### Hadamard Product

The Hadamard product is the element-wise multiplication of two matrices of the same dimensions. If \( A \) and \( B \) are both \( m \times n \) matrices, their Hadamard product \( C \) is:

$$
C = A \circ B, \quad \text{where} \ C_{ij} = A_{ij} \times B_{ij}
$$

For example:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{pmatrix} 
5 & 6 \\
7 & 8
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Their Hadamard product is:

$$
A \circ B = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 \times 5 & 2 \times 6 \\
3 \times 7 & 4 \times 8
\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} 
5 & 12 \\
21 & 32
\end{pmatrix}
$$

#### Properties of Matrices

1. **Commutative Property of Addition**:
   - \( A + B = B + A \)

2. **Associative Property of Addition**:
   - \( (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) \)

3. **Associative Property of Multiplication**:
   - \( (AB)C = A(BC) \)

4. **Distributive Property**:
   - \( A(B + C) = AB + AC \)
   - \( (A + B)C = AC + BC \)

5. **Identity Matrix**:
   - Multiplying a matrix by the identity matrix \( I \) does not change the matrix: \( AI = IA = A \).

6. **Zero Matrix**:
   - \( A + 0 = A \), where \( 0 \) is the zero matrix.

7. **Transpose of a Matrix**:
   - \( (A^T)^T = A \)
   - \( (A + B)^T = A^T + B^T \)
   - \( (AB)^T = B^T A^T \)

8. **Inverse of a Matrix**:
   - For an invertible matrix \( A \), \( A A^{-1} = A^{-1} A = I \), where \( A^{-1} \) is the inverse of \( A \).
