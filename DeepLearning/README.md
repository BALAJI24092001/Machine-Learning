## DEEP LEARNING

1. Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) (basic feedforward neural networks)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (if the task involves image data)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (if the task involves sequence data)
4. Transformer-based Models (for tasks like text classification, e.g., BERT)

### Introduction - (C.M.Bhishop)

- The field of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discovery of regularities in data through the sue of computer algorithms and with the use of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.
- The ability to categories correctly new examples that differ from those used for training is known as generalization.
- For most practical applications, the original input varibles are typically processed to transform them into some new space of variable where, it is hoped, the pattern recognition problem will be easier to solve.
- The data transformation and data pre-processing is called feature extraction. Note that new test data must be pre-processed the same steps as the training data.
- By adopting to a Bayesian approach, the over-fitting problem can be avoided. There is no difficulty from a Bayesian perspective in employing models for which the number of parameters greatly exceeds the number of data points. Indeed, in a Bayesian model the effective number of parameters adapts automatically to the size of the dataset.
